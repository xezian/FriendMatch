# Welcome to FriendMatch!

## Please visit [this link](https://warm-beyond-67051.herokuapp.com/) for a live version of the app
## Some information:
* Friend match is basically a personality matcher based on responses to rating stuff on a scale of 1 thorogh 10
* Try it! It's fun!
* The deployed version linked to above runs through 10 items to be rated, each one a type of social media or other significant web service, which must be answered in the same order to compare with other users' results accurately.
## Additional functionality in development:
* Allow users to add items for other users to rate
* Allow the questions to be answered randomly, pulling only unanswered questions from a much larger array, and storing answers as objects containing the value chosen and the ID of the "question" (item to be rated)
* Allow a user to log back in and see their best match
* Allow users to send a message to their best match
## What is the point?
* "FriendMatch" is an exercise in building and deploying an app that compares user data
* Coding this was more of an exercise in building a full stack web app using express.js and Node.js
* On that note, I appreciate any feedback or communication about the app itself or (even better) my code, including any ideas about how I can improve either.
## Thanks for swinging by, 
## and hang in there.
